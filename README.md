Play by Move
=======
Play by Move is an android application that translates your everyday movement into virtual currency! The Play by Move framework provided here includes a web application dashboard and a client side android application that collects data on your every day movements. This data is then translated to a virtual currency that is hosted on the web. Thorough analytics can be viewed on the data and currency on the dashboard webapp. 

Because Play by Move provides a framework, any developer can integrate Play by move into their application to provide users with a currency experience that will get them moving! 

In collaboration with Intel's Code for Good, this project was a developed to help solve the problem of child obesity. By providing insentive to generate a general currency for any game that integrates with this software, we can get more kids moving. It's not a one shot solution for one game. It will keep children engaged as the Play by Move currency is not integrated with any one game. Any number of games can attach themselves to it. And all you have to do to get more $$$ is get more active!!
